# CAS598-Documentation

Project Overview:
This project is focused on calculating the critical depth for different flow channel sections. Critical depth is a key concept in hydraulic engineering, referring to the specific depth where the flow velocity equals the wave speed in the medium. The program, written in MATLAB, takes into account various channel shapes and physical parameters to compute this critical depth. It handles various channel section types like trapezoidal, rectangular, triangular, and generic.

Installation:
1. Prerequisites: Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Download the Code: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Add to MATLAB Path: Include the folder in MATLAB's path using addpath('path_to_folder').
